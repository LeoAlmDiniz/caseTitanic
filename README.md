#Case: Titanic.
# Case: DATA Analysis Titanic
This data analysis case was developed as result of the class *Introduction to Data Science*  from the bootcamp [CARREFOUR BANK DATA ENGINEER](https://web.digitalinnovation.one/track/banco-carrefour-data-engineer) from [Digital Innovation One](https://digitalinnovation.one).

# Description
In this project, a pack of data downloaded from Kaggle containing roleplay characteristics from Titanic Travelers (_input_), including the fact of whether they survived or not the incident (_target_) is separated according to 30/70 Test/Train ratio to be fed in the Scikit Learn Random Forest algorithm for machine learning.

After training, the algorithm tries to predict whether the 30%-sized testset survives or not.
A HTML page presents the Table 1 containing the original data provided by Kaggle and Table 2 containing the treated 30% test set with the results provided from the original data and the results predicted by the model. Figure 1 presents the original data together with the predicted values in matplotlib fashion.
